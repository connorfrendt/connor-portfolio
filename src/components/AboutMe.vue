                After graduating with a B.S. in Mathematics, I eagerly plunged in head first into the tech world, becoming a Full Stack JavaScript Developer. Complex puzzles and head-scratchers are what I thrive off of. Looking for companies that are driven and have a positive atmosphere. With the knowledge of both front and back end, I am able to see many different perspectives and easily adapt accordingly. My ambition to help others and my craving for more knowledge is what drives me.
