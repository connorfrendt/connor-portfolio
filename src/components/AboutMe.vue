            Hey!  I'm Connor.  I'm an adventure seeking empath, who loves connecting, being active, and trying almost anything!
            People often ask me what my story is, so let me explain...
            Ever since I was a kid I've loved math - derivatives, intergrals, algebra, trigonometry, matrices - you get the point.
            I've also always loved outer space and the universe.  In a nutshell, I have always been fascinated with the unknowns of our world, but that's a story for another time.  I wanted to take my love for mathematics, and my endless curiosity for our universe and combine it.  That's how I ended up wanting to be an astrophysicist in high school.
            Fast forward to college, and I quickly learned that...physics is hard, and is not something that comes to me easily.
            Funny, how math can sometimes seem like a breeze, but as soon as you apply it?  Out the window.  Ha!  Brains are funny, yeah?
            After switching majors a couple times, I thought to myself, "What do I really love?", and just like a boomerang, my love for math came right back to me, and I decided I to major in that.  After graduating with a B.S. in Mathematics, I thought - what now?  I love teaching, but I don't want to be a teacher because they are so overworked and underpaid.  I eventually found some coding bootcamps who teach you, from scratch, to be a software engineer.  And I loved every second.
            Creating virtually anything from almost nothing was so captivating for me. Now here I am, a software engineer, and I couldn't be more happy.
