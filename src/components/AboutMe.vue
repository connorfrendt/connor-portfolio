            <div id="about-me">
                After graduating with a B.S. in Mathematics, I eagerly plunged in head first into the tech world, becoming a Full Stack JavaScript Developer. Complex puzzles and head-scratchers are what I thrive off of. Looking for companies that are driven and have a positive atmosphere. With the knowledge of both front and back end, I am able to see many different perspectives and easily adapt accordingly. My ambition to help others and my craving for more knowledge is what drives me.

                But why?...How?
            </div>
            <div>
                These two questions are how I understand something.  Whenever there's a new concept, I'm always asking "why does it work?", and "how does that work?". Sure, 2 + 2 = 4, but if I don't have an intuitive understanding of what "2" is, it'll be hard to understand why those add up, and even harder to understand why d/dx [e^x] = e ^x, or why e^(iÏ€) + 1 = 0 (how can something with an imaginary number be equal to a real integer?  It's true though!).  Once I figure out how something works, I can use that knowledge over a broader scope and apply it to many different things, much like patterns...
            </div>

            <div>
                Patterns, patterns, patterns...
            </div>
            <div>
                Another process on how I learn is with patterns.  I could jump into the deep end of a programming language that I have zero knowledge on, figure out how it works, break it, fix it, and then add on to it - all because every programming language and application resorts to some sort of pattern.  For example, I once jumped into a Javascript project (back when I had no idea on what Javascript even was), poked around the code and figured out that it was comprised of three different parts - all behaving the same way.  I was able to see a couple working pieces, and a broken piece, and fix what was broken because I understood the pattern and how it worked - all in a language I didn't know!
            </div>

            <div>
                I'm inquisitive by nature, flexible, adaptable, hard working, and if it's related to code (or math!), I'm very happy doing it.
